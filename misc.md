es6 - short for ECMAScript v6
js - is implementation of ECMAScript
es5 - 2008
es5.1 - 2011
es6 - 2015
ECMAScript moving away from version numbers to year releases instead (ES2015/ES15);

When we write es6 we want to serve it down to an end user. In order to do that, their browser needs to support ES6.
Most of the time that is not the case. We need to use some sort of conversion to ES5.
Babel can do this conversion for us.
